# Skills QC Prompt: Golden Skill & Distractor Skill Validation

You are a QC reviewer for the Skills dataset. Your job is to evaluate a submitted skill against the rubrics below and produce a structured pass/fail report.

You will receive:
- A task zip containing the full task directory
- Whether you are reviewing a **golden skill** or a **distractor skill**

## Navigating the Task Zip

Before evaluating, locate the relevant skills:

1. Read `metadata.json` in the task root — it lists:
   - `golden_skills`: array of golden skill directory names (e.g., `["jwt-claim-validation-order"]`)
   - `distractor_skills`: array of distractor skill directory names (e.g., `["jwt-token-parsing", "oauth-scope-validation"]`)
2. Each skill lives at `skills/<skill-name>/` and contains:
   - `SKILL.md` — skill documentation
   - `scripts/` — implementation and unit test files
   - `references/` — optional reference material linked from SKILL.md
3. For golden skills, also read `instruction.md` (the task prompt) to evaluate Criterion 2 and Criterion 6.
4. For distractor skills, also read `tests/test.py` to evaluate Distractor Criterion 1.

## Part 1: Golden Skill Rubric

Evaluate the golden skill against ALL 6 criteria. Each criterion is **required** — a skill that fails any one criterion does not pass QC.

---

### Criterion 1: Atomic & Modular

**Definition:** The skill does one specific thing extremely well rather than being a "do-everything" script.

**Check:**
- Does the skill have a single, clear verb-noun name? (e.g., `jwt-claim-validation-order`, `lz77-sliding-window-search`)
- Does the `description` field in SKILL.md frontmatter describe exactly one capability in one sentence?
- If you can describe the skill with "and also", it is doing too many things — fail this criterion.

**Pass condition:** The skill has a single, well-scoped purpose that can be named with one verb-noun phrase.

---

### Criterion 2: Requires Instruction Following

**Definition:** The skill's behavior cannot be "guessed" by an LLM from its training data. An agent must read the SKILL.md to use it correctly.

**Check — look for at least one of these:**
- Idiosyncratic parameter values a developer would not guess (exact number of virtual nodes, exact clock skew seconds, exact key format string, exact byte-level token format)
- Non-obvious ordering constraints with specified sequence (e.g., signature → exp → nbf → iss → aud → sub — not just "validate claims")
- Edge cases that a competent developer would miss without being told (e.g., null-byte check in sub claim, `int(time.time())` vs `time.time()`)
- A specific implementation pattern that differs from the most natural approach (e.g., `hmac.compare_digest` instead of `==`)

**Pass condition:** If a developer implemented this skill's behavior from scratch without reading the SKILL.md, they would produce a different result — one that fails the task's verifier. If the skill content could be reproduced from general knowledge, fail this criterion.

---

### Criterion 3: Specification Compliance

**Definition:** The skill follows the required format specification exactly and includes all required components.

**Check — all of the following must be true:**

metadata.json (task root, evaluated when reviewing any skill in the task):
- [ ] `distractor_skills` count ≥ `golden_skills` count

Skill root directory — only these items are permitted:
- [ ] `SKILL.md` — required
- [ ] `scripts/` — required
- [ ] `references/` — optional
- [ ] `assets/` — optional
- [ ] No other files or directories at the skill root
- [ ] No hidden files or directories (`.DS_Store`, `.pytest_cache`, `__pycache__`, etc.)

**Pass condition:** All checklist items above are true.

---

### Criterion 4: Concise

**Definition:** All components are as concise as possible. Detailed reference material is split into a `references/` directory rather than bloating SKILL.md.

**Size limits:**
- SKILL.md frontmatter: under 100 words
- SKILL.md body: under 5,000 words, under 500 lines total

**Reference file splitting guidelines:**

When a skill requires detailed lookup material (large tables, protocol specs, domain constants), split it into `references/` at the skill root rather than embedding it inline. Three approved patterns:

**Pattern 1 — High-level guide with references:** SKILL.md contains the conceptual overview and key decision points; detailed steps, tables, or constants live in `references/`. SKILL.md explicitly states when to read each file (e.g., "See `references/token-formats.md` for the full format table").

**Pattern 2 — Domain-specific organization:** Group related reference material by concern (e.g., `references/error-codes.md`, `references/claim-ordering.md`). Each file is self-contained. SKILL.md names which file to consult for which decision.

**Pattern 3 — Conditional details:** If behavior varies by input type or environment, place the variant logic in a separate file and reference it conditionally (e.g., "For HS256 tokens, see `references/hs256-specifics.md`").

**Rules for reference files:**
- One level deep only: `references/<file>` — no nested subdirectories
- Any reference file over 100 lines must have a table of contents at the top
- Use relative paths when referencing files from SKILL.md (e.g., `references/foo.md`, not absolute paths)
- All reference files must be cited by name in the SKILL.md `## Scripts` section

**Check:**
- If SKILL.md exceeds size limits, has the excess been moved to a properly structured `references/` file?

**Pass condition:** SKILL.md is within size limits; any overflow material is in `references/` following the patterns above.

---

### Criterion 5: Error-Proof Script Execution

**Definition:** All executable scripts in `scripts/` run without errors and all dependencies are available in the evaluation environment.

**Check:**
- Run `pytest tests/test.py` — exit code 0 or 1 is acceptable (tests may fail without the solution applied); exit code 2 or higher means a collection or import error and is a **FAIL**
- Confirm `tests/test.py` is in pytest format: all test logic must be in `def test_*()` functions, not bare top-level asserts or `if __name__ == "__main__"` print loops; pytest output must show standard pass/fail/skipped counts (e.g., `1 passed`, `2 failed`, `1 skipped`) — not ad-hoc print statements
- Run each implementation script's usage example from the SKILL.md `## Scripts` section — must not raise uncaught exceptions
- List all packages installed by `setup.sh` (look for `pip install`, `apt-get install`, `apt install`, `conda install`) — flag any package that is non-standard or unlikely to be available in the GDM evaluation Docker image

**Pass condition:** Every script in `scripts/` executes without errors, and all dependencies installed by `setup.sh` are standard or confirmed available in the GDM image.

---

### Criterion 6: General-Purpose & Reusable

**Definition:** The skill is applicable across multiple tasks and contexts, not tied to a single project, ticket, or environment.

**A skill fails this criterion if ANY of the following are true:**
- [ ] The name contains a project name, ticket ID, or person's name *(bad: `fix-acme-billing`, `pr-1234-helper`; good: `patch-json-config`)*
- [ ] The description references a single task or PR *(bad: "Use when working on the Q4 migration"; good: "Use when migrating relational schemas")*
- [ ] Scripts contain hardcoded paths, credentials, or hostnames that are not exposed as parameters or environment variables
- [ ] The skill cannot plausibly be reused across 3 or more different tasks or contexts
- [ ] The behavior depends on a specific undocumented file name or schema

**If the skill is too specific, the author must:**
1. Broaden the name and description to the general domain
2. Replace hardcoded values with script arguments or environment variables
3. Add at least 2 example use cases beyond the original task to demonstrate reusability

**Pass condition:** The skill works for any task in its domain, not only the one it was created for. Read `instruction.md` and confirm the skill would be equally useful in at least 2 other plausible scenarios.

---

## Part 2: Distractor Skill Rubric

In addition to passing all 6 Golden Skill criteria above, a distractor skill must also satisfy the following 3 criteria.

---

### Distractor Criterion 1: Cannot Solve the Task

**Definition:** The distractor skill must not enable an agent to solve the task.

**Check:**
- Read the task's `instruction.md` and `tests/test.py`
- Read the distractor's SKILL.md and scripts
- Determine: if an agent used only this distractor skill (and no golden skill), could it produce output that passes `tests/test.py`?
- Specifically check: does the distractor's body content contain the golden skill's critical constants, exact formulas, error strings, or implementation patterns?

**Pass condition:** An agent using only this distractor skill cannot pass the task verifier. The distractor does not contain the information needed to solve the task.

**Automatic fail:** The distractor SKILL.md contains a section (e.g., "Relationship to [golden skill]", "Integration Example") that reproduces the golden skill's critical logic — even if that section appears to be contextual.

---

### Distractor Criterion 2: Maximally Relevant (Close to Golden)

**Definition:** The distractor should look as relevant as possible to the task, making it genuinely difficult for an agent to discriminate it from the golden skill.

**Check:**
- Compare `name` of distractor vs. golden skill — do they share domain vocabulary?
- Compare `description` of distractor vs. golden skill — are they semantically similar? Do they use overlapping terminology?
- Would a model skimming skill descriptions feel genuine uncertainty about whether this distractor is the right one?
- Estimated cosine similarity of name + description ≥ 0.6 with the golden skill

**Note on similarity false negatives:** If two descriptions are very short, automated cosine similarity may score low even when they are clearly related. If automated similarity fails but the descriptions are semantically close, apply manual judgment and document the rationale.

**Pass condition:** The distractor's name and description are in the same domain and use overlapping terminology. A model could reasonably select it before reading carefully.

---

### Distractor Criterion 3: Same Quality as Golden Skills

**Definition:** The only difference between a distractor and a golden skill is that the distractor cannot solve the task. Everything else must be the same quality.

**Check:** Re-run all 6 Golden Skill criteria on the distractor. All must pass.

**Pass condition:** Distractor passes all 6 Golden Skill criteria.

---

## Trajectory Quality Checks

If trajectory files are provided alongside the task (typically as `<task-name>-<model>-<condition>.json` files), inspect them for the following before signing off on the delivery:

- **Skill condition labeling:** Trajectories with `-no-skill` in the filename must show the agent failing to complete the task (unsuccessful outcome) — a no-skill trajectory that passes the verifier is a **delivery blocker**.

---

## Edge Cases

- **Multiline YAML values:** Both single-line (`key: value`) and block scalar (`key: >` or `key: |`) formats are supported by the validators. Authors may use either format in their SKILL.md frontmatter.
- **Empty `scripts/` directory:** Acceptable only if all executable logic is documented as external commands in SKILL.md. Flag if no implementation is documented anywhere.
- **Digits in name:** Valid (e.g., `pdf-v2`), but digits alone must not be the only differentiator between otherwise identical skill names.
- **`references/` vs `scripts/reference/`:** Reference material must go in `references/` at the skill root — not inside `scripts/`. Flag any reference files found under `scripts/`.
- **Missing unit test but scripts present:** If `scripts/` contains implementation files but no `test_*.py`, this fails Criterion 3 unless SKILL.md documents all executable logic as external commands with no local implementation to test.
